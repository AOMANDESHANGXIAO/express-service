# Express-Template
This is a template for an express project. I have already configured the automatic import of routing and middleware.

## how to use
1. npm install
run this command in your terminal
``` bash
npm install
```
2. npm start
run this command in your terminal. This script will start the server when you have installed the nodemon.
``` bash
npm start
```
